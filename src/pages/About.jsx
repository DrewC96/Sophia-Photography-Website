            <h4>Sophia Rojas – Nature Photographer</h4>
            <p>Hi, I’m Sophia Rojas — born and raised in Nebraska and passionate about wildlife and environmental conservation storytelling. Through my photography, I aim to capture the beauty of our world and inspire a deeper connection to nature. Each image tells a story — of life, balance, and the importance of protecting the planet we call home. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work and most importantly…enjoy!</p>
